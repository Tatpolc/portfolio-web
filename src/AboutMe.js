            <article>
                <p>I am a self-taught front-end developer. This is the new chapter of my Life.</p>
                <p>I started studying web-development from scratch. Although before this I've been messing around with some Python and SQLite. You can learn more about this project in the <Link className="underline hover:text-[#1877f2]" to="/project">Project</Link>.</p>
                <p>The reason that I become a front-end developer is because I don't have a computer science degree and I feel that this route is the best route for me to enter the programming world.</p>
